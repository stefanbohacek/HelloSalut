HelloSalut: Hello as a Service
==============================

Say hello to your visitors in their native language!

1. Get your visitor's IP address and/or default language using your preferred methods*
2. Make a call to HelloSalut
3. Say hello!

The service is currently in beta while I'm adding more languages and countries. For a live example and more information, please see https://stefanbohacek.com/hellosalut/hello/
